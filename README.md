# Quantum-chain

A tool chain to generate nearest neighbour complaint
circuit for arbitrary topologies.

## Tool chain workflow
The toolchain takes two primary parameters as input 
+ Quantum circuit in real format [(Specification details)[http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/rev_lib/doc/docu/revlib_2_0_1.pdf]]
+ Quantum Computer Qubit interaction graph. The [IBM](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) Q16 qubit interaction graph is shown below.

Letâ€™s say that the circuit C has _n_ qubits and the graph _G_ has _k_ qubits
### Topology extraction

Multiple subgraphs of _n_ qubits are extracted from the graph _G_. Each subgraph has a unique topology and no two subgraphs are isomorphic. A probabilistic approach is used for choosing the subgraph. 128 tries are made to extract the topologies.  Let the topology graph be _T_.

### NN-circuit generation
We use an ILP solver to optimally generate a NN-complaint circuit from the input circuit C and a topology graph _T_. Furthermore, we use _n*n_ steps for generating the NN circuit. Another interesting constraint is the mapping of the individual qubits in the circuit to the vertices in the
topology graph _T_. We consider some random mappings of the qubits to the vertices for generating multiple variants of NN-complaint circuit. 

## Tool chain usage 

### Installation
The tool is implemented in Python3 and tested on Ubuntu 18.04.  Install the depedencies from `requirements.txt`. 

You need a valid installation of [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/resource/starting-with-gurobi/) along with the Python wrapper. Academic license can be obtained for free via their [website](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/).

### Running instructions
We demonstrate the usage of the tool by means of an example.
+ `sample_ckt.real` : Input quantum circuit  with 4 qubits (`a`, `b`, `c` and `d`)
+ `qx15.gml` : Quantum computer graph with 16 qubits
   
``` 
cd quantum-chain
python3 qchain.py ./tests/sample_ckt.real ./tests/qx15.gml 
```

### Output
The output is written to `./genfiles/sample_ckt` folder. The name of the subfolder in `genfiles` is same as the name of the input quantum circuit. Multiple solutions are generated by the tool.
+ `sample_ckt_i.cfg` : The qubit configuration of i^th solution. The first number denotes the vertex id and the second number indicates the qubit.
+ `topofiles/qx15_4_2.gml` : 2nd Topology graph extracted from qx15 with 4 qubits.
+ `sample_ckt_qx15_4_2_i.real`: The ith NN complaint Quantum circuit for topology graph `qx15_4_2`.
