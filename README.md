# Quantum-chain

A tool chain to generate nearest neighbour complaint
circuit for arbitrary topologies.

## Tool chain workflow
The toolchain takes two primary parameters as input 
    * Quantum circuit in real format [(Specification details)[http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/rev_lib/doc/docu/revlib_2_0_1.pdf]]
    * Quantum Computer Qubit interaction graph 

Letâ€™s say that the circuit C has _n_ qubits and the graph _G_ has _k_ qubits
### Topology extraction

Multiple subgraphs of _n_ qubits are extracted from the graph _G_. Each subgraph has a unique topology and no two subgraphs are isomorphic. A probabilistic approach is used for choosing the subgraph. 128 tries are made to extract the topologies.  Let the topology graph be _T_.

### NN-circuit generation
We use an ILP solver to optimally generate a NN-complaint circuit from the input circuit C and a topology graph _T_. Furthermore, we use _n*n_ steps for generating the NN circuit. Another interesting constraint is the mapping of the individual qubits in the circuit to the vertices in the
topology graph _T_. We consider a few random mappings of the qubits to the vertices for generating the
final NN-complaint circuit. 

## Tool chain usage 

### Installation
You need a valid installation of [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/resource/starting-with-gurobi/) along with the Python wrapper. Academic license can be obtained for free via their [website](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/).

### Running instructions
    
    * `sample_ckt.real` : Input quantum circuit  with 4 qubits (`a`, `b`, `c` and `d`)
    * `qx15.gml` : Quantum computer graph with 16 qubits
   
``` 
cd quantum-chain
python3 qchain.py ./tests/sample_ckt.real ./tests/qx15.gml 
```

### Output
The output is written to `./genfiles/sample_ckt' folder. Multiple solutions are generated by the tool.
    * `sample_ckt_i.cfg` : The qubit configuration of i^th solution. The first number denotes the vertex id and the second number indicates the qubit.
    * `topofiles/qx15_4_2.gml` : 2nd Topology graph extracted from qx15 with 4 qubits.
    * `sample_ckt_qx15_4_2_i.real`: The ith NN complaint Quantum circuit for topology graph `qx15_4_2`.
